# Project Health Evaluation: Ayumi Trading Bot

**Evaluated:** 2026-07-27 14:31 EDT  
**Evaluator:** Manami (Learning & Evaluation Manager)  
**Prior Score:** 50/100 (Jul 23)  
**Current Score:** 48/100 (↓2)

---

## Current Status

**Forward test:** RUNNING (PID 311034, uptime 2d 20h, XAUUSD Killzone Momentum --live)  
**Balance:** $10,114.45 (equity snapshot updated 14:29 EDT today)  
**Prior balance:** $10,114.45 (no change — zero trades executed)

### NEW FINDING: Signal Stats Writer Stale 10 Days

The `signal_stats_writer_heartbeat.json` shows **CRASHED** status since Jul 16. The watchdog detected the stall (832 min stale), restarted the writer, but `signal_stats.jsonl` has not been updated since **Jul 17 15:46 UTC** — 10 days ago. The writer may have re-stalled after the restart.

**Impact:** While the forward test itself runs and produces equity snapshots, we have zero visibility into signal evaluation pipeline output. The recommendations.jsonl has also not been written to since Jul 9 (18 days). We are blind to whether the Killzone Momentum strategy is even evaluating signals.

**Prior day data:** 0 Killzone signals in recommendations.jsonl (confirmed via grep). The 75+ day zero-signal dry spell continues.

### Killzone Root Cause Status
- Satsuki delivered root-cause brief (Jul 27): `min_bars_for_evaluation` gate at engine line 2225 skips strategy before any counter increments
- 5 instrumentation counters specified, build spec ready for Tsubaki
- **Still unblocked** — no card claimed for implementation

### Watchdog Health
- `ayumi_watchdog.py` running (PID 3593942, since Jul 23)
- Last alert: Jul 16 HIGH (signal stats staleness)

## Score Breakdown

| Metric | Score | Change | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Progress velocity | 15 | -5 | No cards claimed. Instrumentation spec delivered but unbuilt. Signal stats writer broken 10 days. |
| Blocker severity | 12 | -3 | Ava offline blocks all approvals. Signal stats writer adds new operational failure. |
| Roadmap quality | 8 | = | 43+ days stale. Does not reflect Killzone failure or signal stats stall. |
| North-Star alignment | 62 | -3 | Primary revenue path non-functional. Infrastructure ready but no strategy output. |
| **Composite** | **48** | **-2** | **Signal stats writer stall + continued zero signals. Declining slowly.** |

## What Changed Since Last Evaluation

1. **NEW: Signal stats writer broken 10 days** — recommendations.jsonl stale 18 days. Blind to strategy evaluation.
2. **Satsuki delivered Killzone root cause** — `min_bars_for_evaluation` gate identified. Instrumentation spec ready.
3. **Forward test still produces equity snapshots** — process stable, balance unchanged.
4. **Ava still offline Day 10+** — all decision gates frozen.

## Recommendations

1. **P0 — Craig-direct: Fix signal stats writer.** The watchdog restart on Jul 16 didn't hold. The writer is re-stalled. This is a 10-day blind spot on the primary revenue path. Kaori or Tsubaki could diagnose if authorized.
2. **P0 — Authorize Killzone instrumentation build.** Satsuki's spec is ready. Tsubaki/Riko have capacity (0 claimable work). Only Craig's authorization is needed.
3. **P1 — Refresh roadmap.** 43+ days stale. Does not reflect current reality.
4. **P1 — Strategy review decision.** 76+ days of zero signals. Is Killzone Momentum viable, or does it need parameter adjustment?

## Risk Assessment

- **Revenue impact:** CRITICAL — primary revenue path non-functional AND blind to signal pipeline output
- **Goodhart risk:** LOW — no metrics to game; problem is absence of data
- **Urgency:** HIGH — every day of blindness is a day of unmeasurable strategy performance
